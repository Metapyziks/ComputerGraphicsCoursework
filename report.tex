\subsection{Ship Model}
The ship model itself was created using the free 3D modelling application Blender, which also handled vertex normal and UV coordinate calculation. The finished model was then exported as a Wavefront OBJ (.obj) file, which could then be imported into my application using a parser written by myself.

The model is split into several groups, which I have called `Face Groups' within the application. The purpose of the groups was to allow different parts of the ship to have different material effects; and in the case of the outboard motor and propeller, to have a different transformation applied before rendering.
